## Description

This repository contains all the files and code for the *IBM Applied Data Science Capstone* project, which focuses on predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket landings. The project aims to use data science techniques to build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a successful landing based on historical flight data.

The project involves:

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming data to make it suitable for model training.
**Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features that enhance model accuracy.
**Model Selection:** Experimenting with various machine learning models to make predictions.
**Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of models using appropriate metrics.
**Deployment:** Ensuring that the model can be used in a real-world application for SpaceX launch predictions.

##Objective

The primary objective is to predict whether a Falcon 9 rocket landing will be successful or not based on flight related features.
