## Description

This repository contains all the files and code for the *IBM Applied Data Science Capstone* project, which focuses on predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 stage 1 rocket landings. The project aims to use data science techniques to build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a successful landing based on historical flight data.

The project involves:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming data to make it suitable for model training.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features that enhance model accuracy.
3. **Model Selection:** Experimenting with various machine learning models to make predictions.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of models using appropriate metrics.
5. **Deployment:** Ensuring that the model can be used in a real-world application for SpaceX launch predictions.

## Objective

The primary objective is to predict whether a Falcon 9 stage 1 rocket landing will be successful or not based on flight related features.
